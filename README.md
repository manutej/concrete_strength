# Concrete Compression Strength Machine Learning Modeling

Testing various models to find best predictor of concrete compressive strength.

This project was inspired by playing with and building with concrete materials. I found a dataset on UCI Machine Learning Respository that happened to match with my recent creative interests. In this project, the plan is to explore various models in order to develop a working model that is best able to predict concrete compressive strength given input parameters about the material based on composition from various components. 

**Please note: this work is still in progress**
